# Mods downloading guide.

This document will  go into where to download the mods needed to make your server run smoothly.
Therefor this is a recommendation, and not a requirement. Also for copyrights sake.

Keep an eye on: https://smapi.io/mods for possible mods that supersede the current ones.

You should download the mod from the given link, unless SMAPI says otherwise. And then place it into the mods folder, so you will have:

```
Mods/ (folder)
  AutoLoadGame (folder)
  ..other mods
```

## AutoLoadGame (Nexus Mods)

The first mod, AutoLoadMods is needed for automatically loading the save game when the container is restarted.

## Multi-User Chests

This mod is here so multiple users can access a chest at once. Which is kind of nice in a multiplayer server.
